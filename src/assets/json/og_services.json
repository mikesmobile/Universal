                "questions":{
                    "How does exterior shading work":"Exterior Sun Control Screens absorb and dissipate a large percentage of solar heat and glare before it reaches windows and doors. This results in a more comfortable indoor temperature, more efficient air conditioning and ultimately energy conservation.",
                    "Are Sun Control Screens easy to clean":"Yes, they only need an occasional cleaning with mild soap and water. They are also mildew and fade resistant.",
                    "Do Sun Control Screens come with a warranty":"Yes, Phifer offers a warranty on Exterior Sun Control Products. Contact us to request warranty information",
                    "Do Sun Control Screens block airflow":"Exterior sun control products still allow good airflow.",
                    "How are Sun Control Screens at insect protection":"These products protect against insects and can replace regular insect screening on windows, doors and porches.",
                    "Does Sun Control Screening look like standard insect screening":"Sun Control Screening is available in a wider range of colors than regular insect screening. From the outside, sun control screening offers a uniform look to windows and doors, providing a more aesthetically pleasing overall look to home and building exteriors than regular insect screening. Outward visibility remains good through exterior sun control.",
                    "​If I am replacing my insect screens with Sun Control Screening, what spline size should I use":"The product that is being installed and the screen frame opening determine spline size. Measure across the opening of the screen frame spline groove and use one size smaller spline for fabrication.",
                    "​Do Sun Control Screens provide privacy":"Solar screens can provide daytime privacy. Visibility through Sun Control Screens depends on light location. Lighted interiors allow inward visibility at night, while sunlight during the daytime diminishes inward visibility, offering more privacy.",
                    "Which products provide extra strength":"SunTex: Heavy-duty mesh is tear and puncture resistant.",
                    "Will Sun Control Screens affect houseplants":"No. Most houseplants require filtered light. Shading reduces yellowing and water loss. In most cases, plants do better with shading than without but will require some amounts of direct sunlight.",
                    "Can Sun Control Screens be installed over different shapes of windows":"Yes. All shapes and sizes of windows can be shaded with sun control products including rakes, octagons, circles, etc.",
                    "What should be the payback period from utility savings after installing Sun Control Screens":"Many Sun Control Screen payback period estimates fall between two and three cooling seasons. Studies have shown that shaded windows can save up to 25% of the cost of air conditioning when compared to unshaded windows.",
                    "How do Sun Control Screens compare to glass tinting":"Glass tinting filters the light along with the UV rays. Sun Control Screens reduce the volume of light without filtering. As the glass filters sunlight through the tint, it will maintain heat, which dissipates into the house, making sun control screens more effective than glass tinting for energy savings.",
                    "If I have reflective light-colored drapes or blinds, are Sun Control Screens still beneficial":" Yes, along with the heat that is absorbed by the drapes/blinds, they are also subject to UV damage. The combination of light-colored interior shades and dark exterior screens will provide optimum results.",
                    "Should Sun Control Screens be removed in the winter":"To protect carpets, drapes and furniture from damaging UV rays, the Sun Control Screens should remain in place even during cooler months. However, if passive solar heat gain is desired in the winter months the screens can be removed and stored until springtime.",
                    "Can Sun Control Screens be removed to clean the windows":"Yes, although windows and doors are kept cleaner with the Sun Control Screens installed, they are removable just like insect screening for ease in washing screens and window glass.",
                    "​How much will Sun Control Screens darken the interior":"While UV blockage is 65% to 90%, the Visual Transmittance is 14% to 40% depending on the screening fabric selected. Light through the Sun Control Screen is not tinted, but it is reduced in volume, allowing good light with reduced glare.",
                    "What color Sun Control Screen is more effective for heat reduction":"All colors provide significant heat reduction when installed on the exterior but dark colors are better at reducing glare and improving outward visibility.",
                    "How much ultraviolet light do Sun Control Screens block":"UV blockage depends on the fabric’s weave and openness. In general, the UV blockage percentage will be the reciprocal of the openness factor.",
                    "What is the GREENGUARD® Certification":"GREENGUARD is an indoor air quality certification program for low emitting products. GREENGUARD tests products’ chemical emissions by evaluating over 75,000 chemicals, including volatile organic compounds, carcinogens and reproductive toxins. All Exterior Sun Control fabrics are GREENGUARD certified.",
                    "What is Microban®":"Microban antimicrobial protection is infused into SunTex fabrics to inhibit the growth of bacteria, mold, and mildew."

If you already own a Pride Deluxe Pet Door, then yes, you only need to purchase the Pride Door Screen Adapter. We also have the Pride Pet Door for Screens that includes both.",
                    "Is there a clear version of the flap available":"Currently, there is no clear flap available. The solid black is a durable solution that blocks out sunlight.",
                    "My Johnson model had side magnets, does this have side magnets too":"This replacement for the Johnson models does not have side magnets in the Small, Medium, and Large.",
                    "How do I lock this at night or when I am out of town":"A locking cover comes with every purchase. You can slide it on either side of the frame to let your pet know they cannot enter from outside or the inside",
                    "What is the flap made out of":"The flap is made out of recycled tire rubber. This does make it heavier, so smaller pets may need training in order to use the door.",
                    "How thick does my door have to be in order to install this":"There is no thickness required since it is not self framing. You or a contractor will have to frame out the door or wall.",
                    "Can I get the U shaped piece by itself":"The U shaped piece is not sold separately, it comes with the replacement flap should you need another one.",
                    "What kind of weather does this work against":"The insulation value is moderate, so it might not be the best choice for climates with extreme wind, cold or hot weather.",
                    "What is the locking cover made out of":"The cover to secure the opening is made of fiberboard. It is prone to damage from rain so be sure to keep it away from extreme moisture.",
                    "Can I install this in a steel door":"Yes! This can be installed almost anywhere, although we suggest installing in solid core materials.",
                    "I would like to purchase this in replacement of my Johnson frame, are they going to fit the hole in my door exactly the same":"The dimensions should be pretty close. We would suggest double checking your existing rough cut to make sure this new item will fit. For any flap size, the rough cut dimension is included in the size chart."

Some masons will simply use mortar mix to create a new top for the chimney. The problem with that is, mortar mix will crack and leak very quickly and is not a weather resistant material. A cement chimney crown that is properly designed to overhang the outside dimensions of the chimney structure is the best solution. When your chimney crown becomes cracked or has lost pieces of its original shape it no longer is doing the job that it needs to. Once your chimney crown begins deteriorating and falling apart, it won’t be long before serious damage will set in to your entire chimney. It may be worth a visit to your roof once in a while to do your own inspection of the chimney crown. Don’t take our word for it – just take a quick drive around downtown and look up at the older masonry chimneys. Most of them are literally falling apart from the top down. The last thing someone needs is bricks falling down or costly repairs. When we service our customers with their annual inspection and chimney cleaning, the chimney crown is a key area that we look at. If there are any defects at all, we suggest an immediate crown seal to prevent more damage."

Any breaks or openings in the chimney liner can lead to serious problems, potentially allowing a spark or floating ember to escape into the area between the lining and the chimney. The chimney needs a non-combustible lining that allows complete and efficient venting of the smoke, gases and particulate matter that drafts out of your chimney. Chimney liners can be made of many materials like clay tiles, cast masonry mix, aluminum or stainless steel. Any small cracks, breeches or deterioration can affect the way your entire system performs. If gases or combustible materials escape into attics, walls or ceiling spaces that are next to the chimney a fire may start or smolder causing damage and life-threatening conditions."

                "title":"How Do I Know If I May Need A New Chimney Lining?",
                "description":"If your chimney is not pulling smoke up and out of your home, you may have problems with the chimney lining. Smelly fireplaces can also mean that your creosote and soot is building up quickly and may indicate other problems with chimney liners. The inside of your chimney needs to be cleaned regularly and a qualified chimney sweep may see potential chimney lining problems during routine cleaning. Sulfur in smoke when mixed with moisture can cause a corrosive reaction and eat small holes in metal liners over time. Clay tile liners always deteriorate and develop cracks that open up the chimney to moisture and will eventually create structural problems that require expensive repairs or even rebuilding. If you see pieces or chips of your clay tiles in your firebox, you can be sure that you need to have your liner inspected for serious defects. Any time that a customer converts to a new type of heating system, installs a new wood stove, fireplace insert or other heating appliance they need to make sure that the chimney liner matches the output requirements of the new system. Wind, snow and rain combined with freeze and thaw cycles can take a toll on your chimney. Make sure things are buttoned up and tight when it comes to your chimney lining on the inside, and you will have much longer life of the chimney structure on the outside. The number one reason for chimney fires is because of a faulty chimney liner. Actually many older homes had chimneys built with no chimney liner at all! There are ways to upgrade these historic homes by adding chimney liners that will add years to the life of the chimney and make for a much safer operation. Today the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) requires in their code that all masonry chimneys have a liner."

Pre Fab or Zero Clearance Fireplaces (ZC’s) are different from masonry fireplaces in that they are not made of brick and mortar. Instead, ZC’s are made out of very thin sheet metal and refractory cement panels. ZC’s get their name for two simple reasons; “Pre Fab” because they are a sheet metal fireplace “pre-fabricated” in a factory. “Zero Clearance” because there’s very little “clearance” between the flammable 2X4 wood framing of your home and the metal box. Often flammable 2X4’s are located within ½ inch of the sheet metal! If you were to light a fire in this box with damaged or missing refractory panels, two things could happen. First, the metal could get really hot and warp, thus permanently damaging the fireplace itself. Secondly, and worst of all, as the metal got hot, you chance having the heat transfer onto the nearby flammable 2X4 studs, thus catching the house on fire! To keep this from happening, the Pre Fab Fireplaces have refractory cement insulating panels in the box which keep the metal cooler. Like any other household appliance, with use, these panels eventually wear out and need to be replaced. Radiant Firebacks can significantly increase the lifespan of your refractory panels and at the same time make your fireplace more efficient."

The rule of thumb (suggested by most manufacturers) is that once you can either get the edge of a credit card into the crack or once the panel is cracked all the way through (it flexes when you press on it lightly), it must be replaced. Also, if no cracks are visible, but chunks of the cement have fallen off (spalling) picture, it should be replaced, as well. Continued fires with damaged panels is risky business, so don’t risk it! If your panels need replacement, do not continue to burn fires until damaged panels have been replaced by a qualified professional."

Make sure to also burn with dry and seasoned wood only! Any pieces that are wet or unseasoned typically create more creosote. Our approach to chimney de-glazing begins with assessing the situation. Once we have found evidence of chimney glazing we will leave you with the proper chemicals needed to begin the de-glazing process. After an application of this chemical, we have you burn while using this for the next 1-2 weeks before we return to sweep out the broken-down glaze. Any remaining glaze will be attended to with either chemical or physical agitation with some requiring both. Once the chimney de-glazing process is complete we will instruct you on the probable cause of the glaze and further prevention."

Any severe cracks will allow more heat to be transferred underneath your fireplace hearth which is never a good idea!

Replacing a hearth and it's surround makes a big, drastic difference in the way a fireplace looks"

As with the brick of a chimney stack, it must be able to handle both the potential corrosive elements of the burned material and the high heats it can be subjected to. While a chimney cleaning will definitely remove fresh soot, a stained hearth of either many years of neglect or heavy burning will leave you with a stain you can never really get rid of. The only way to permanently remedy this is to replace these stained bricks with fresh new ones!"

A fireplace hearth is no different. With age and use, a chimney hearth will start to degrade over time. These bricks however can be replaced so that you can enjoy the look of a fresh new fireplace or change the look of bricks that never appealed to you. With your fireplace hearth being directly in front of the logs you are burning whether you have a fireplace grate or not, these bricks are constantly absorbing heat. While a fireplace grate certainly prolongs the life of a hearth and firebox, if logs were burned previously without one, your fireplace hearth may be taking quite some damage! So be sure to call Mike's Mobile Screen & Chimney Service for any future fireplace repair needs!"

Waterproofing your brick/veneer structure will help ensure that your brick work lasts as long as possible. Your brick and your home can benefit tremendously from waterproofing. Most sealants are made with siloxane, which chemically bonds to the material and prevents water from passing through it. This type of brick waterproofing sealant is clear, so it does not change the appearance of the building. In fact, rather than staying on the surface of the structure, brick sealant penetrates the material. It will need to be reapplied to older brick structures about every four to seven years, and newer buildings approximately every five to ten years."

Most people don’t know their dryer vents need to be cleaned. They clean out their lint filter now and then and think that’s it. But the dryer vent duct is where lint can really build up and get clogged. Lint is highly flammable, accounting for most dryer vent fires. In addition to lint buildup, improper installation of your dryer vent system can also pose a serious danger to you. Our dryer vent cleaning professionals will detect potential hazards such as the presence of flammable vinyl duct or a duct run that is improperly routed.
