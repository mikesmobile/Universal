When we saw the Viewguard doors online they looked so clean and weren't like the standard \"home improvement store\" security doors that everyone else in the neighborhood had. We've been really happy with the look and quality of these doors. We had a minor issue with the weather stripping not being secured, Mike's sent an installer the next day to properly set them into place. Visitors have asked about the screens and we've happily referred them to Mike's."

Their customer service was excellent from the beginning clear through to the end. Daniel and Estafan (sorry if I spelled wrong)  called when they were on their way, and arrived on time.  They had some challenges with my front door, but were persistent and professional about it till they got it done.  They also put 3 sliding security screen doors on my patios.  I am extremely happy with the work that they did.  They were super friendly and cleaned up everything before leaving.  I would certainly recommend Mikes' Mobile to any one needing any of their services.  I know I will call them in the future for any of my needs."

When we saw the Viewguard doors online they looked so clean and weren't like the standard \"home improvement store\" security doors that everyone else in the neighborhood had. We've been really happy with the look and quality of these doors. We had a minor issue with the weather stripping not being secured, Mike's sent an installer the next day to properly set them into place. Visitors have asked about the screens and we've happily referred them to Mike's."

Now I'll have a cooler house because I can open the front door (and the cat won't get out) and I'll feel a lot more secure.  I was a bit skeptical at first, however the company was so highly recommended I through I would give it a try.   The wait for the door was a tad long I originally thought, then I reminded myself it was a custom door, virtually hand made just for me!!     The color matched perfectly!

Their customer service was excellent from the beginning clear through to the end. Daniel and Estafan (sorry if I spelled wrong)  called when they were on their way, and arrived on time.  They had some challenges with my front door, but were persistent and professional about it till they got it done.  They also put 3 sliding security screen doors on my patios.  I am extremely happy with the work that they did.  They were super friendly and cleaned up everything before leaving.  I would certainly recommend Mikes' Mobile to any one needing any of their services.  I know I will call them in the future for any of my needs."

She arrived on time, always a plus, and explained the cleaning process inside and on the roof and answered all of my questions.  The area inside was kept clean throughout the entire process.  She reviewed a detailed report with pictures at the end of the service and repair recommendations without being pushy.  I won't hesitate to have Mike's clean my chimney in the future."
